                    In addition, Karyna often answers questions personally in her Instagram DMs, especially
                    about exercises, progress, or how to adapt the program to your level.

                    Not at all.<br>About 80% of our students start exactly where you are — stiff, tight, and
                    unsure where to begin.
                    The program is built to:<br>
                    • adapt to your current level<br>
                    • progress gradually and safely<br>
                    • help you feel stronger and more mobile step by step<br>
                    You don’t need to be flexible to start — flexibility comes from the process.

                    You can easily stream the workouts using one of these options:<br>
                    1. Open the platform directly through your Smart TV browser<br>
                    2. Use your phone or laptop + Smart TV with Cast or Screen Mirroring<br>
                    3. Connect your device to the TV using an HDMI cable<br>
                    You can also train from a PC or laptop — just open the platform link sent to your email.
